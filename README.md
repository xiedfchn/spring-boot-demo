Spring Boot is an open-source micro-framework used to build Spring applications with the help of microservices. Spring Boot helps developers to start coding right away without wasting time on preparing and configuring the environment.

## Key Advantages 
- Fristly, it is based on Java, which is one of the world's most popular programming languages, besides that, Spring Boot can help you to quickly build any applications without having to worry about their safe and correct configuration.

- Spring Boot has a huge user community which means you can find free learning materials and courses. Spring Boot is multi-threaded. This is useful when performing long and repetitive operations. When the main thread is consumed, others are used concurrently.

- Reduces the time spent on development and increases the overall efficiency of the development team.
- Helps to autoconfigure all components for a production-grade Enterprice application.
- Facilitates the creation and testing of Java-based applications by providing a default setup for unit and integration tests.
- Helps to avoid all the manual work of writing boilerplate code, annotations, and complex XML configurations.
- Comes with embedded HTTP servers like Jetty and Tomcat to test web applications.
- The integration of Spring Boot with the Spring ecosystem which includes Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring ORM, and Spring JDBC is easy.
- Provides many plugins that developers can use to work with embedded and in-memory databases smoothly and readily.
- Allows for easily connecting with database and queue services like Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, ElasticSearch, Rabbit MQ, ActiveMQ, and many more.
- Provides admin support â€“ you can manage via remote access to the application.
- Eases the dependency and comes with Embedded Servlet Container.
- Offers flexibility in configuring XML configurations, Java Beans, and Database Transaction.
- Offers easy access to Command Line Interface which makes the development and testing of Spring Boot apps built with Java or Groovy agile.
